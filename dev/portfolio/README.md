# Portfolio

Use this folder to begin to curate past projects, code snippets, research, and other content in development that you may like to use for your own Portfolio.

**For example...**  
Add past project work, code snippets, and ideas in progress to this folder. Consider how some of this work can be repurposed for your own portfolio. For development credit, begin to refactor or enhance this work.

This can include...

- Adding inline code comments
- Adding, fixing, or continuing to work on features
- Organizing work into sub folders

<br>

**Note:** Organize portfolio work into sub-folders and include README files to explain the work in progress. Review [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) to generate ideas for your README files.
