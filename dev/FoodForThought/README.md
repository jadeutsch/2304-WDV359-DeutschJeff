## Maintenance

Maintenance should include updating packages on a regular basis, at least once every month. This includes, but not limited to, updating any used packages. Should any breaking changes occur that require immediate action, a notice to users must be sent out with an approximate timeframe (if at all possible) for how long it will take make these updates. This notice should also be posted across the various social platforms to capture the attention of the users.
