## 30-Second Pitch

A thirty-second pitch, as described in [this article from Duke University]([1]), is a great way to make a first impression and is used as a way to answer the question: "Tell me about yourself." Also called an "elevator pitch," it shout e an overview of experience skills, strengths, accomplishments, and goals. It's most commonly used in a professional setting, such as interviews, cover letters, networking evens and career fairs, and cold-calls.

- Basic Structure
  - Introduction
  - Discussing Experience
    - As a student, one would mention their field of study
    - If one has obtained practical experience, it should also be included
  - Stating a strength or skill an employer would find interesting...
  - Following it up with an accomplishment (or two) proving the strength or skill
    - It can be related to school, work, volunteer work, activities, etc.

## Project Proposals

According to [this article from Uptech]([2]), project proposals, sometimes called "Request For Proposal" or RFP, are documents that outline project specifications and ask for potential vendors to come back with bids for work. Often RFPs for software are written for sourcing IT services. RFPs are a great way to ensure a successful collaboration between the company and the IT outsourcing partner.

- RFP for Software Structure
  - Company Description
    - Provide a comprehensive overview that is short, organized, and specific
    - It should explain the company's background, what the company does, and what are its values and culture
  - Project Overview
    - Be clear about why the RFP is being issued; the more "why's" provided, the more responses received, and an easier decision-making process
    - Answers questions like, "what are the problems to be solved," "what has been tried and failed," and "what are the limitations."
  - Scope of Work
    - A list of expectations about the working relationship between the company and the outsourced IT services, and the work itself
  - Deliverables
    - The measurable results after the collaboration
  - Technical Requirements
    - Details regarding programming languages, platform requirements, technical restrictions, etc.
  - Project Management
    - This section describes more of the communication rules about using specific management and communication tools
  - Budget Details
    - Short and concise, detailing how much is exactly is planned on being spent for the project
  - Evaluation Criteria
    - Lists how proposals will be evaluated so it details what the company finds most valuable and makes sure things aren't neglected
  - Process Description
    - Describes the entire process from meeting with vendors, submitting RFPs, development, etc.
- Tips
  - Share as much as possible (transparency is key)
  - Pay attention to the engagement level
  - Give some space (requirements can be clear, but leaving some wiggle room for creativity is also a good thing)

## Startup Valuation

[Upcounsel's article]([3]) states startup valuations are the values of startups determined by the markets and sectors the business is in. Factors that play into this include money supply and demand, and the level of need for money by the business. They also define a startup as "a new business that potentially grows quickly and tries to fill a need in a market by developing and offering new products, processes, or services but still has issues to deal with."

- Good Valuation Requirements
  - Traction (more customers means more money)
  - Reputation (having a great track record of coming up with good ideas)
  - Prototypes (A sample of the product or service the company can display)
  - Revenues (more important to B2B startups than consumer startups)
  - Supply & Demand (the ratio between business owners seeking money and the investors will to invest and pay premiums)
  - Distribution Channel (where the startup sells its product)
  - Hotness of Industry (the popularity, or rise in, of the industry the startup is part of)
- Bad Valuation Items
  - Poor Industry (industry with poor performance or is dying off)
  - Low Margins
  - Competition
  - Management Not Up To Scratch (the management team not having a track record, reputation, or is missing key positions)
  - Product (doesn't work, is not popular, or not a good idea)
  - Desperation (business owner seeking investment because they are close to running out of money)
- Funding Stages
  - Seed Funding (funding from people known to the business, or by someone unknown to the business called an "Angel Investor")
  - Round "A" Funding (funding used to establish a product in the market)
  - Round "B" Funding (for startup expansion)
  - Debt Funding (money raised through a loan, debt, or lines of bank credit once the startup is established)
  - Mezzanine Financing and Bridge Loans (the last round of funding leading up to a leveraged buyout or an initial public offering)
  - Leveraged Buyout (the purchase of a company)
  - Initial Public Offering (company shares are sold on a public stock exchange)
- Valuation Methods
  - Venture Capital
