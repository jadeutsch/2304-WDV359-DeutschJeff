## Style & Brand

[Style tiles]([1]) are design deliverables consisting of fonts, colors, and interface elements communicating visual branding. Below are some helpful tips in creating a great style tile.

<br>

### Color Psychology

According to [this article from Bookmark]([2]), color has a major impact on human behavior, even getting its own branch from behavioral psychology called _color psychology_. The colors you choose have a subconscious impact on how people react and interpret your brand.

- Blue
  - trust, security, dependability, and calm
- Purple
  - royalty, nobility, luxury, glamour, creativity, imagination, and wisdom
- Pink
  - sweetness, love, feminity, warmth, and nurturing
- Red
  - urgency or excitement, passion, intensity, love
- Yellow
  - happiness, cheer, joy, positivity (but sometimes warning or caution)
- Orange
  - sense of competition, sociable, friendly
- Green
  - harmony, life, wealth, nature
- White
  - sophistication and elegance, breathability (in terms of space)
- Black
  - mystery, elegance and luxury, powerful, sophistication
- Brown
  - earthy, natural, organic, dependability, reliability

### Color Theory and Palettes

Aside from color psychology, color theory also plays an important role in deciding colors for your branding. As stated in [this article by CareerFoundry]([3]), "color theory is a framework that informs the use of color in art and design, guides the curation ofo color palettes, and facilitates the effective communication of a design message on both an aesthetic and a psychological level." Below is a brief intro color theory and palette design.

- Color Theory
  - Primary colors (cannot be created by combining two or more colors)
    - red, blue, yellow
  - Secondary colors (created by combining any two primary colors)
    - orange, purple, green
  - Tertiary colors (created by combining a primary and secondary color)
    - magenta, vermillion, violet, teal, amber, chartreuse
- Color Wheel
  - charts primary, secondary, and tertiary colors along with their respective hues, tins, tones, and shades
  - Hue
    - pure pigment without tint or shade, any of the primary and secondary colors are categorized as this
  - Shade
    - refers to how much black is added to a hue
  - Tint
    - refers to how much white is added to a hue
  - Tone
    - refers to how much grey (only black and white) is added to a hue
  - Color Temperature
    - Warm
      - contains shades of yellow and red
    - Cool
      - contains tins of blue, green or purple
    - Neutral
      - browns, grays, black, and white
- Color Palette
  - Usually made up of 6 colors: 1 dominant color, 4 accent colors, and 1 text color
  - Don't skimp on contrast: the greater the contrast between text and background, the better the legibility
  - When in doubt, common UI conventions can help (such as classic CTA colors)
  - Schema Types
    - monochromatic
      - various tones and shades of one single color
    - analogous
      - 3 colors that sit next to each other
    - complementary
      - colors that are directly opposite of each other
    - split-complementary
      - 3 colors; one dominant color and two colors adjacent to the dominant color's complement
    - triadic
      - 3 colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel
    - square
      - 4 colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel
    - tetradic
      - 2 sets of complementary color schemes that outline a rectangle on the color wheel

### Typography

In Tracy Osborn's book, [_Hello Web Design_]([4]), one of the sections she covers is Typography. Typography, as she states from Wikipedia, "is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed." Through much of this section, Osborn provides a great overview about typography

- Fundamentals
  - Typeface categories
    - fonts are either considered serif or sans-serif, but further subcategories are referred to: slab serif, monospace, display, and handwriting
  - Leading and line height
    - the space between lines of text
  - Kerning and letterspacing
    - kerning changes the spacing between a pair of letters while letterspacing changes the spacing between all letters
- Principles
  - limit designs to two typefaces (but style however you'd like)
  - avoid justifying or centering blocks of text
  - lines fewer than 45 characters and longer than 75 characters per sentence are hard to read

Design is something I struggle with in terms of complete creation, so hopefully having these resources on hand will help make things easier.
