## Wireframes

Wireframes are a great place to start the planning of the app you are building. As stated in [this article by CareerFoundry]([1]), "wireframes provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, and intended behaviors." Below are some things to remember about wireframes:

### Three Types of Wireframes

There are [three types of wireframes]([1]) with the most distinguishing factor between them being the amount of detail they contain.

1. Low-fidelity wireframes
   - basic visual representations of a webpage
   - omit any detail that could potentially be a distraction
   - used for starting conversations, deciding navigation layout, and mapping user flow
   - ideal for stakeholders or clients in the room needing something sketched up real quick
2. Mid-fidelity wireframes
   - most commonly used wireframe of the three types
   - still avoid images and typography, but assign more detail to specific components and features are clearly differentiated from each other
   - varying text weights can be used to separate headings and body content
   - shades of grey communicate visual prominence of individual elements
3. High-fidelity wireframes
   - boast pixel-specific layouts
   - may include actual featured images and relevant written content
   - ideal for exploring and documenting complex concepts such as menu systems or interactive maps

### The Do's and Don'ts of Wireframing

While wireframing is an important step in the design and development process, there are something to remember about what to, and not to, do when creating wireframes. From [this article on Mockplus]([2]), here are 10 do's and don'ts of wireframing and a brief explanation of why.

- Do:

  1. Research before creating wireframes
     - research what users need and want
     - consider two goals: business and user
  2. Keep wireframes simple

     - wireframing promotes speed and simplicity over other design aspects
     - helps avoid distractions and focuses on conveying ideas with clarity

  3. Show a variety of ideas
     - generate as many ideas as possible
     - producing multiple ideas and variations on a single idea allows one to see the ups and downs of each idea
  4. Make sure that wireframes are easy to follow
     - they're a tool for communication
     - everyone should be able to follow the concept, otherwise something's wrong if only one person can follow the concept
  5. Collaborate
     - brainstorming ideas together with others increases the potential for good outcomes
     - showing wireframes to other team members early on helps validate and improve your thoughts, while feedback helps improve your work

- Don't:

  6. Skip some parts of your app
     - wireframing every part of the app prevents missing some vital part of user interaction that might affect user experience
  7. Start with digital tools
     - stick with the simple, pen and paper sketch first before moving to digital tools
  8. Use colors
     - grayscale prevents distractions caused by color
     - initial wireframing lays out content and describes functionality
  9. Try to make wireframes look pretty
     - wireframes aren't design comps/mocks so they don't need to look like the finished product layout
     - wireframes are meant to help understand information hierarchy, not visual or interaction design
     - focusing on design creates a polished wireframe that isn't solution-oriented
  10. Get too attached
      - be ready to discard your designs
      - try lots of different options and only after that choose one or two which would be used as a prototype foundation

### Creating Great Wireframes

According to [this article from the Balsamiq Wireframing Academy]([3]), creating wireframes are easy, but great wireframes solve real problems.
Below are the steps to creating great wireframes:

1. Articulate

   - understand the **_who_** and **_what_** you are designing for
   - having use cases and a user profile helps understand the need for the design

2. Generate

   - create as many ideas as you can without judgement or critiques
   - if you get stuck or don't like an idea, skip to another idea
   - speed and quantity are your friend here

3. Iterate

   - piece together the best parts and combine them so they address the needs
   - add in missing details or steps overlooked in the initial generations
   - continue to leave out finer details

4. Communicate

   - wireframes communicate the story behind it and instructions for developers
   - restate the original problem to explain design choices to stakeholders
   - adding annotations pointing to specific areas can help explain use cases

5. Validate
   - gather feedback about the design
   - make sure the design is worth building
