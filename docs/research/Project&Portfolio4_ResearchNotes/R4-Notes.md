## Design Theory

Design theory, broken down in [this article]([1]), "is a system of ideas that explains how and why design works." These notes will provide a basic overview of this system.

## Design Principles

Searching for "design principles" leads to any number of articles stating there are between five and twelve design principles, with just as many more articles stating, in agreement, with what they actually are. For these notes, 12 principles will be briefly summarized based on [this article]([2]):

1. Contrast
   - refers to how different elements are in a design, more specifically adjacent elements
     - an important aspect of accessibility as, for example, contrast between text and background color determines how readable something is on a website
2. Balance
   - refers to how each element of design (typography, colors, images, etc) carries visual weight and the need to lay them out on a page in a way that creates "balance."
   - two types: symmetrical (design that lays everything out equally across an imaginary center line) or asymmetrical (elements of differing weights laid out in relation to a line not centered within overall design)
3. Emphasis
   - refers to parts of design meant to stand out, meaning the most important information the design is meant to convey
4. Proportion
   - refers to the size of elements in relation to one another
5. Hierarchy
   - refers to the importance of elements within a design (i.e. the most important elements or content should appear to be the most important)
6. Repitition
   - refers to reinforcing ideas or unifying a design to bring together a lot of different elements
     - e.g. repeating same colors, typesfaces, shapes, or other elements of a design
7. Rhythm
   - refers to the space between repeating elements creating a sense of rhythm or flow
   - 5 types of rhythm
     - random (no discernable patter)
     - regular (same spacing between each element without variation)
     - alternating (an overall set, repeating pattern with variation between actual elements)
     - flowing (spacing follows bends and curves)
     - progressive (spacing changes between elements, adding space with each change from the previous iteration)
8. Pattern
   - can refer to the repetition of multiple design elements working together or the set of standards for how certain elements are designed
9. White Space
   - aka "negative space", refers to the areas of design that don't include an design elements
10. Movement
    - refers to the way the eye travels over a design (elements should lead from most important to least important)
11. Variety
    - creating visual interest and should reinforce other elements of the design
12. Unity
    - refers to how well elements of a design work together and helps ensure concepts are being communicated in a clear, cohesive fashion

## Design Thinking

As explained in [this article]([4]), design thinking "is a process concered with solving complex problems in a high consumer-centric way." Below are the five phases of design thinking.

1. Empathize - Gather High-Quality Consumer Understanding
   - obtain all the data you need about consumer needs, barriers, attitudes and aspiration in regards to the application idea
   - make sure to have a clear understanding of what it is the consumer needs without your own bias
2. Define - Create a Brilliant Design Brief for All Stakeholders
   - as stated in [another article]([5]), a design brief "is a document that defines the core details of an upcoming design project, including its goals, scope, and strategy."
   - this design brief should essentially act as a roadmap or blueprint that informs the design decisions and guides the overall workflow of the project from conception to completion
3. Ideate and Collaborate
   - this is where all the brainstorming, mind-mapping, landscape mapping, etc happens.
   - generate lots of ideas here before settling on a couple designs
   - no prototyping or wireframing should be done here
4. Prototype - Hold Inspirational Rapid-Sketch Sessions or Design Sprints
   - start making prototypes to test out these ideas so you can start showing others
5. Test - Get Fast, Productive Feedback From Human Beings
   - start testing out the prototypes yourself and from others
   - gather feedback if things work as expected or not, and adjust prototypes accordingly
