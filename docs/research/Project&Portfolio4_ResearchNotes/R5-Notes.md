## Plans for Production

Planning for production can be a daunting process. This article on [Monocubed]([1]) talks about the "web development life cycle" which is all the stages that go through building a website/app. There are seven stages in this cycle: Research, Planning, Designing, Content Creation, Development, Testing, and Maintenance. While portions of the life cycle have been researched already (see [R2-Notes]([2]), [R3-Notes]([3]), and [R4-Notes]([4]) for basics of Research, Planning, Designing, and a little Content Creation), these notes will cover Development, Testing, and Maintenance

## Development/Coding

As stated in [this article by Macronimous]([5]), the development (or coding) stage is where it is "the programmer's turn to add code without disturbing the design." This stage focuses on one to three types of development:

1. Front-end Development
   - focuses on the aspects of the design the user interacts with: navigation, buttons, dropdown menus, etc.
   - consists of at least four subcategories:
     - layout (HTML)
     - styling (CSS, SCSS/Sass, Less, Tailwind),
     - functionality (JavaScript, ReactJS, VueJs, Angular)
     - state management (Context API, Redux)
2. Back-end Development
   - focuses on the aspects of the design the user does not interact with: local/session/persistent storage, databases, seo, etc.
   - this is also where all the application logic, routing, and APIs are integrated for use with the front-end

## Testing

[Techuz]([6]) talks about the testing part of the web development life cycle. They mention how web apps will go through rigorous and meticulous testing before being deployed to an eventual server. Some of these tests are:

- Unit testing (testing the smallest parts of an application for proper operation)
- Stress testing (testing that verifies the stability and reliability of software applications)
- Load testing (non-functional testing of performance under a specific expected load)

<br>

## Deployment/Maintenance

This section of the life cycle deals with where the web app is uploaded to for the world to see, and what to do about maintenance.

1. Deployment (examples of sites where you can deploy apps)
   - [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com)
   - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
   - [Expo](https://expo.dev) (for mobile apps)
2. Maintenance

- requires continuous feedback from users to make updates as needed, whether that be bug fixes, patches, and minor or major updates (such as new features or new versions)
