# [Concept Name]

## Project Proposal
This week you will revisit an existing project or pitch an entirely new idea. Begin with your research and then return to this document. Update the "Application Definition Statement" keeping your research on the "30-second pitch" in mind. You may use a portion of this work in our discussion board this week. 

**Note:** If you plan to work on an existing project, review the "Change Order" instructions below as well. 

<br>

## Application Definition Statement

*A clear high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to "What are you building?”. You will explore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here.* 

*Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement.*

## Target Market

*Using research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.*

*Are there any secondary markets that have overlapping defining characteristics? Do those markets impact design or accommodation considerations for this project?*

## User Profile

*User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market.*

## Use Cases

*Defining a typical use case or scenario that a user would be interacting with your application provides a fixed path of interaction that you can refine your user’s experience around. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout does requiring them to clicking 10+ times make sense while they are impatiently trying to start their exercise regimen? Use cases help to think through how your application will commonly be used.*

*Use Cases will help to drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. Regularly testing as if you were a user following a use case throughout the project development lifecycle will provide valuable insight into how your application is addressing the needs of the user and allow you to correct missteps early.*

## Problem Statement

*In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research.*

## Pain Points

*Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations.*

## Solution Statement

*How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?*

## Competition

*What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own.*

## Key Features

*Define key features intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key features should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points. More generic features like User Authentication should not be defined here.*

## Integrations

*Use of an API is expected. This can be 3rd party APIs, your own API, or a combination of data sets. Identify which integrations are planned for and outline how you will use them transformatively. For 3rd party APIs provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service.*

# Change Order
If you have an existing project, make sure the overall scope of the project is captured in this proposal document. Also include the following informaton:

* Confirm this document summarizes the proposed project scope: Yes or ? 
* Describe how much work is left to do ( a rough estimate is fine )
* List and describe any proposed changes to the original project scope

Keep in mind, approval is needed for proposed work and may include peer or instructor review(s). If you are unsure about your proposed ideas feel free to reach out to us for guidance.
