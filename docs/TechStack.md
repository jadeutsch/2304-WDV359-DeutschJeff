## Project Initiation: Tech Stack
This week you will revisit an existing project or pitch an entirely new idea. Begin with your research and then return to this document. Fill out the headings below with your Tech Stack information. List the tools and technology you would like to use for your project. Explain your reasoning for this as well. For example, how does the proposed tool or technology provide value to your overall portfolio of work?
