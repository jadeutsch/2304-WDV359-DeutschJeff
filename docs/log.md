## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This past week, I worked on getting my repo set up, all the necessary documentation required (tech stack and proposal), week 1 research, and project initialization.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - The only challenge I had was getting back into the groove of using the GitHub project and branches workflow again.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I did a little more research into what kinds of packages are out there for React Native and there are a lot that can help speed up the process of building an application. Packages such as React-Native-Paper for pre-designed elements.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - My plan for week 2 is to start building out the application. I have all my issues already set for what I'm going to be working on, and I will be adding in the content to those to further specify the pieces of each large feature.

<br>

### Week 2

⚙️ Overview - This week, I worked on the business case research about metrics and analytics, and developing the restaurant list screen and bottom navigation menu.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - My challenge this week was time management. To be honest, it's been a little difficult in motivation to get things done, but it's something I have to push through to make sure I'm meeting the requirements I've set for this project.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I was really proud of building out the bottom navigation and impressed with how well the React Native documentation for navigation provides such detailed examples. It makes working on this project a lot easier because of how well-written everything is.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - My next steps are to work on integrating data, building out more of the search functionality, and introducing the back-end and user authorization/authentication.

### Week 3

Stay tuned, this stand up is coming soon...

### Week 4
