## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This past week, I worked on getting my repo set up, all the necessary documentation required (tech stack and proposal), week 1 research, and project initialization.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - The only challenge I had was getting back into the groove of using the GitHub project and branches workflow again.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I did a little more research into what kinds of packages are out there for React Native and there are a lot that can help speed up the process of building an application. Packages such as React-Native-Paper for pre-designed elements.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - My plan for week 2 is to start building out the application. I have all my issues already set for what I'm going to be working on, and I will be adding in the content to those to further specify the pieces of each large feature.
